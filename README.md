# Bitwise-Operators
Aim: To study and implement C++ Bitwise operators

Theory: Bitwise operators are used in C++ to perform operations at the bit level. These operators are highly efficient and are commonly used for low-level programming, graphics, and tasks requiring optimal performance. The main bitwise operators are: Bitwise AND (&): Sets each bit to 1 if both corresponding bits are 1.

Bitwise OR (|): Sets each bit to 1 if at least one corresponding bit is 1.

Bitwise XOR (^): Sets each bit to 1 if the corresponding bits are different.

Bitwise NOT (~): Inverts all bits of the operand.

Left Shift (<<): Shifts bits to the left, multiplying the number by 2 for each shift position.

Right Shift (>>): Shifts bits to the right, dividing the number by 2 for each shift position
